## Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and here is the link
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village
  Only Potato disease was covered.We have a total of 1000 pictures of Leaves with Early Blight, 1000 pictures of Late Blight and 152 pictures of healthy leaves.
* We did some data augmentation like flipping and rotation to get better results.
* 80% of dataset was used for training. 10% for validation and 10% for testing.
## Resolution
The  image resolution  is 256*256.
